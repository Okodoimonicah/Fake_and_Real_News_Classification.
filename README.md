### Project Description:
    With the current technology, almost every individual has an access to internet and there are no strict restrictions to what one posts. With this, people can obtain     news from them and believe that they are legitimate which might not be case. Feeding information from the internet can affect oneself in one way or another. To         avoid this, this project aims to analyse data using text classification with NLP to determine wether an article posted is real or not.
    

### Technologies Used:
    
    
    
    


### Project Features:
    From the data set, the project focuses on the text column as the independent and subject column as the dependent variable.
    


### Project Future Use:
    Using this project one will be able to tell whether or not an article is legitimate or not which will improve on how people percieve on things.
